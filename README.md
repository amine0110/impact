This repository is dedicated to a workshop about machine learning, more about it please [see this](https://le-click.be/impact/).

## Tutorial Structure
In this repository you can find 4 different notebooks, there is one main notebook and other additional tutorials (that can be done separately).
- [Preprocessing 3D and 2D medical imaging using MONAI.](preprocessing_methods.ipynb) - [Open in colab.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FwoqCg5-Wwut0ln7BqELkxGP_nFw0JrL?usp=sharing)
- [The best Python libraries for medical imaging.](special_libraries.ipynb)
- [CNNs for medical image classification.](CNN_Medical_Imaging.ipynb)
- [ViT for medical image classification.](ViT_Medical_Imaging.ipynb)

And also there is a script that needs to be run locally that is about how to [visualize one or multiple 3D STLs](pycad_example.py) using PYCAD.

## Installations
In case you want to run the notebooks locally, please consider installing the required libraries using the requirements files.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
